<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m **Dacheng Zhou (周大成)**, currently a visiting research student at **EPFL**, advised by [**Prof. Josie Hughes**](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/create/). I am also a second-year Master’s student at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), majoring in **Robotics**.

Before that, I received my B.Eng degree from the [College of Electronic and Information Engineering](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/), [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) in June 2024, where I was fortunately supervised by [Prof. Rui Fan](https://www.ruirangerfan.com/).

My research interests include **computer vision**, **robot perception**, **robot manipulation**, and **biomedical signal processing**. 

Currently, my work focuses on **robot tactile sensing** and **reinforcement-learning-based manipulation**.
