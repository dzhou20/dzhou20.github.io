<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m a visiting research student at EPFL, advised by [Prof. Josie Hughes](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/create/). I am also a second-year M.S. student at Aalto University, majoring in Robotics. Previously, I received my B.Eng degree in Automation from [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/) in June 2024, where I was fortunately supervised by [Prof. Rui Fan](https://www.ruirangerfan.com/).

My research interests include computer vision, robot perception, robot manipulation, and biomedical signal processing. Currently, my work focuses on **robot tactile sensing** and **RL-based manipulation**.

If you are interested in connecting with me, please feel free to reach out.
