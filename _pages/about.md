<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m Dacheng Zhou (周大成), a fourth-year undergraduate student at the [College of Electronic and Information Engineering](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/), [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/), majoring in Automation. I was fortunately supervised by [Prof.Rui Fan](https://www.ruirangerfan.com/) during my undergraduate study.

My primary research interest includes computer vision, robot perception, and biomedical signal processing.
